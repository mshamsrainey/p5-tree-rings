"Every life begins this way--a child reaching its hands towards the sky, a seedling poking through the earth. A collection of cells knitted together to form a burgeoning new life.","Mother nature knows nothing of the new year, but sometimes it's as if she does. The forest shines under its soft light."
This new life is enthusiastic.,What will this year bring for the forest? For the tree growing in the middle of it?
"It’s still young and small, but it doubles and triples in size in a matter of weeks. Its first leaf is a victory now, but one day it will have thousands.","The forest lies like fresh snow in winter. Almost eerily silent except the occasional crunch of snow and leaves underfoot of a small animal. These seasons always pass, but there's some beauty in the silence too."
The barely-sprouted seed’s youth is a beauty unto itself and a portal into a beautiful future.,"Eventually the snow will melt, as it always does. The birds will return from their migration come springtime, and the bears will emerge from hibernation and drink from the defrosting streams."
What horizon will the young tree's branches reach?,"The return to life after the winter is a routine every tree in the forest comes to know well. Long before their new leaves start to sprout, they feel the encroaching warmth deep in their limbs."
How will its leaves change in the fall? The falls beyond it?,"When spring finally arrives, the trees become home to returning migratory birds. Can you hear the chirping overhead?"
"Everything is unknown, overflowing with potential.",Spring showers moisten the soil the trees wrap their roots in. They nourish themselves and feast upon the spring sunlight.
"Over time, the young seedling’s stem browns in the sunlight, toughening into a thin layer of bark. Its branches spout new leaves that stretch into the sky, seeking light.","In this season of growth, even the oldest trees are full of possiblity. What new heights will its branches reach? What new lives will make their homes among the leaves?"
"As the seedling grows taller, its roots grow deeper. It reaches deep into the ground and far across the surface.","The trees never rush their growth, though--they know they have many more springs ahead of them, many more chances."
The seedling breathes in new life and learns to thrive where it’s rooted.,Temperatures are heating up now. Flowers and their pollen cover the forest. Perhaps somehow the trees take note of their favorites?
"Sooner or later, the young sapling starts to settle into itself. It grows taller, stretching up to a few feet, and sturdier.","Dense summer haze descends upon the forest. The trees probably almost wish they could wilt in the heat, but they stand tall."
"Rooted, the growing tree is less breakable now, more permanent.",When did the warmth of summer become stifling? When did the memory of winter's chill begin to fade? Even the trees want what they no longer have.
"The sapling burrows its tendrils into the earth, tapping deep into the ecosystem to hold itself steady.","How long does a season last? When does one fade and another begins? There are no clear lines in nature, only sunset gradients."
"Fully grown, the tree is home to families of birds. Every morning, they chirp softly to welcome the new day.","Autumn doesn't start with technicolor and crisp leaves, but simply with a slight cooling off. A welcome change for the sweltering trees."
"Sunlight filters through the tall branches, morning dew gathers on the grass beneath.","As a chill settles into the air, the trees leaves slowly, imperceptibly at first, start to turn in on themselves."
"The tree's roots are intertwined with others. It is a part of the ecosystem now, holding and being held dear by the lives around it.",Do the autumn trees know how beautiful their colors are?
A tree's life is a small infinity.,"Even as the trees shed their leaves and the birds leave for warmer climates, they stand tall and proud."
"The whole forest watches as a sapling touches the sky for the first time, but what about the ones who have touched it day in and day out, unflinching, for years? They watch the others from their perch, but it can be a lonely view.",There will be snow upon the ground soon enough. The loop will close and repeat itself again. What is left in a year? What does a year even amount to?
Perhaps trees intertwine their roots to feel held? Perhaps to know they won't be left behind?,"Days are shorter this time of year. Part of nature as it may be, the darkness can feel lonely at times. The trees dig their roots deeper into the ground to feel connected."
,"Come winter, the trees welcome the cold back in like an old friend. Life and death, spring and winter, the trees have long traced their cycles, drawn rings around them."
